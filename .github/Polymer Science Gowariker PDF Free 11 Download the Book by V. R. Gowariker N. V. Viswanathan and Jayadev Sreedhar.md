# Polymer Science by Gowariker: A Comprehensive and Accessible Textbook
 
Polymer science is the study of the structure, properties, synthesis, processing and applications of polymers, which are long-chain molecules composed of repeating units. Polymers are ubiquitous in nature and in human-made materials, such as plastics, rubber, fibers, coatings, adhesives and more.

One of the most popular and widely used textbooks on polymer science is *Polymer Science* by Vasant R. Gowariker, N. V. Viswanathan and Jayadev Sreedhar. This book was first published in 1986 by Wiley and has been reprinted by New Age International. It covers the fundamental aspects of polymer chemistry, physics and technology in a clear and concise manner. It also includes numerous examples, problems, tables, figures and references to help students and teachers alike.
 
The book is divided into 14 chapters that cover topics such as chemistry of polymerization, molecular weight and size, chemical and geometrical structure, glass transition temperature, crystallinity in polymers, copolymerization, individual polymers, polymer degradation, polymer reactions, polymer solutions, experimental methods, elastomeric, fiber-forming and plastic materials and polymer processing. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in polymer science and engineering as well as for professionals working in the field.
 
One of the advantages of this book is that it is available online for free download from various sources. For example, one can download the pdf version of the book from the Internet Archive[^1^] or from Scribd[^3^]. Alternatively, one can also view the book on Google Books[^2^], where some pages are previewed. However, one should be aware that these sources may not have the latest edition or the best quality of the book. Therefore, it is advisable to buy or borrow a hard copy of the book from a library or a bookstore if possible.
 
*Polymer Science* by Gowariker et al. is a classic and comprehensive textbook that provides a solid foundation for anyone interested in learning more about polymers. It is written in a simple and lucid language that makes it easy to understand and follow. It is also updated with the latest developments and trends in the field of polymer science. It is a must-read for students, teachers and practitioners of polymer science.
  
In this section, we will briefly review some of the main topics covered in the book *Polymer Science* by Gowariker et al.
 
## Chemistry of Polymerization
 
Polymerization is the process of forming polymers from monomers, which are small molecules that can react with each other to form larger molecules. There are two main types of polymerization: chain polymerization and step polymerization. In chain polymerization, a monomer initiates the reaction by forming a reactive species, such as a free radical, an ion or a coordination complex, that adds to another monomer to form a longer chain. This process continues until the chain is terminated by a coupling or a disproportionation reaction. In step polymerization, two or more monomers react with each other to form a dimer, which then reacts with another monomer to form a trimer, and so on. This process continues until the desired degree of polymerization is reached.
 
The book discusses the kinetics, mechanisms and thermodynamics of various types of chain and step polymerization reactions, such as free-radical, ionic, coordination and condensation polymerization. It also explains the factors that affect the rate and degree of polymerization, such as temperature, pressure, catalysts, inhibitors and solvents. It also introduces the concept of living polymerization, which is a type of chain polymerization that does not involve any termination steps and allows for precise control over the molecular weight and architecture of the polymers.
 
## Molecular Weight and Size
 
Molecular weight is a measure of the mass of a molecule or a polymer chain. It is an important parameter that influences the physical and chemical properties of polymers, such as melting point, viscosity, solubility, elasticity and strength. There are different ways to define and measure the molecular weight of polymers, such as number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw), z-average molecular weight (Mz), viscosity-average molecular weight (Mv) and polydispersity index (PDI). The book explains the concepts and methods of calculating and determining these molecular weight parameters using techniques such as colligative properties, osmometry, light scattering and viscometry.

Molecular size is a measure of the dimensions or shape of a molecule or a polymer chain. It is also an important parameter that influences the physical and chemical properties of polymers, such as solubility, diffusion, crystallization and entanglement. There are different ways to define and measure the molecular size of polymers, such as radius of gyration (Rg), hydrodynamic radius (Rh), end-to-end distance (Re) and persistence length (lp). The book explains the concepts and methods of calculating and determining these molecular size parameters using techniques such as light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and fluorescence spectroscopy.
