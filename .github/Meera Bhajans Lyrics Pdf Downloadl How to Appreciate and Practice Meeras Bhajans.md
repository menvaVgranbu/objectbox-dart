## Aisi Laagi Lagan Meera Bhajan Lyrics
 
This is one of the most famous Meera bhajans, sung by many artists including Anup Jalota. The title means "Such a deep attachment has Meera felt". In this bhajan, Meera describes how she has become completely absorbed in the love of Krishna, and how she has renounced her worldly life and pleasures for his sake. She says that she wanders around singing his praises, and that she has become a yogini (a female ascetic) in his service. She also says that no one can stop or dissuade her from loving Krishna, and that he is the only source of her happiness.

In this bhajan, Meera expresses her anguish at being separated from Krishna, and how she cannot live without him.

She says that she suffers from countless sorrows, but she only utters Krishna's name from her mouth. She also says that she roams around in the forest like a madwoman, but she has found her beloved Krishna who is the giver of joy.
