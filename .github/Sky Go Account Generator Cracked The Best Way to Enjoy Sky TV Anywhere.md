Sky Go is a great service that lets you watch your favourite Sky TV shows on various devices, such as your phone, tablet, laptop or computer. You can stream live, on demand and catch up TV from your Sky package at no extra cost to your Sky TV subscription[^1^]. But what if you want to watch Sky Go on more than one device at the same time? Or what if you want to download shows to watch offline when you don't have an internet connection? That's where Sky Go Extra comes in.
 
## What is Sky Go Extra?
 
Sky Go Extra is an add-on service that allows you to watch Sky Go on up to four devices at the same time, instead of the usual two. It also lets you download shows and movies to your devices, so you can watch them offline whenever and wherever you want. You can store up to 25 hours of content per device for 30 days[^2^]. Sky Go Extra is ideal for families who want to watch different things on different devices, or for travellers who want to enjoy Sky TV without worrying about data charges or Wi-Fi availability.
