Arduino is an open-source platform that allows you to create and control electronic devices with a simple programming language. Arduino 1.0.1 is the latest version of the Arduino software (IDE) that includes many bug fixes and new features, such as support for the Arduino Leonardo board and multiple languages[^1^] [^2^]. In this article, we will show you how to install and use Arduino 1.0.1 software on Windows.
 
## Step 1: Download the Arduino Software (IDE)
 
You can download the Arduino software (IDE) from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows). You can choose between the Installer (.exe) and the Zip packages. We suggest you use the first one that installs directly everything you need to use the Arduino software (IDE), including the drivers. With the Zip package you need to install the drivers manually. The Zip file is also useful if you want to create a portable installation[^1^].

## Step 2: Install the Arduino Software (IDE)
 
Once you have downloaded the Arduino software (IDE), run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You can choose the components to install and the installation directory[^1^]. The installation process will extract and install all the required files to execute properly the Arduino software (IDE). It will also install the drivers for your Arduino board, so you can connect it to your computer via USB.
 
## Step 3: Launch the Arduino Software (IDE)
 
After the installation is complete, you can launch the Arduino software (IDE) by clicking on its icon on your desktop or in your Start menu. You will see a window like this:

The Arduino software (IDE) consists of several parts[^3^]:
 
- A text editor for writing code, with syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
- A message area that shows feedback from the compiler and other information.
- A text console that shows serial output from your Arduino board.
- A toolbar with buttons for common functions, such as verifying, uploading, opening, saving, serial monitor, etc.
- A series of menus that provide access to various settings and tools.

## Step 4: Choose Your Board and Port
 
Before you can upload code to your Arduino board, you need to select the type of board and the port it is connected to. To do this, go to Tools > Board and choose your board from the list. For example, if you have an Arduino Leonardo, select "Arduino Leonardo" from the menu[^2^]. Then, go to Tools > Port and select the port that corresponds to your board. It should be labeled with "Arduino" followed by your board name. For example, if you have an Arduino Leonardo connected to COM3, select "COM3 (Arduino Leonardo)" from the menu.
 
## Step 5: Write Your Code
 
Now you are ready to write your code for your Arduino project. You can use the text editor in the Arduino software (IDE) to write your code, or you can open an existing sketch from File > Examples or File > Open. A sketch is a file that contains your code for your Arduino board. Every sketch has two main functions: setup() and loop(). The setup() function runs once when your board is powered on or reset, and it is used to initialize variables, pin modes, libraries, etc. The loop() function runs repeatedly after setup(), and it is used to perform the main logic of your program[^3^]. For example, here is a simple sketch that blinks an LED connected to pin 13:
