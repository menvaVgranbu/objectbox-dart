# How to Install and Use Advanced Design System 2009 on Windows
 
Advanced Design System (ADS) is a powerful software for designing and simulating electronic systems. It provides a complete set of simulation technologies ranging from frequency and time-domain circuit simulation to electromagnetic field simulation. ADS lets you fully characterize and optimize your designs in a single, integrated design environment[^3^].
 
If you want to install and use ADS 2009 on Windows, here are the steps you need to follow:
 
**DOWNLOAD ->>->>->> [https://t.co/pt8ZIO4g1f](https://t.co/pt8ZIO4g1f)**


 
1. Download the ADS 2009 installation image from the Keysight website[^2^]. The file size is about 1.74 GB, so it may take some time depending on your network speed.
2. Extract all files and folders in the ADS2009XXX.zip folder. You can use any unzip software or right-click on the folder and select "Extract All". Note the location where you extract the files.
3. Navigate to the location of the unzipped files and double-click on the setup.exe file to start the installation wizard. Follow the instructions on the screen to install ADS 2009 on your PC.
4. When the installation is complete, note the License ID (hostid) and click Done. You will need this information to request a license file from Keysight.
5. Request a license file from Keysight using the online License Request Form[^2^]. You will need to provide your License ID, product name, version, and serial number. You will receive your license file via email.
6. Save the license file to the C:\\<installation folder="">\\licenses folder. For example, C:\\ADS2009\\licenses.</installation>
7. Start ADS by clicking on the ADS icon on your desktop or from the Start menu. If you have multiple license bundles, you can select one using the Agilent License Preference Tool before running ADS[^2^].

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and activated ADS 2009 on Windows. You can now use it to design and simulate your electronic systems. For more information on how to use ADS 2009, refer to the product documentation[^2^] or contact Keysight support[^2^].
